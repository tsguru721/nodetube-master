1) Point your domain towards your IP

1) Generate a CSR
# from server where you'll use key
$ openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout server.key -out server.csr

Instructions for how to fill it out:
https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9446/14/generating-csr-on-apache--opensslmodsslnginx--heroku/

2) Activate your CSR
https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/794/67/how-do-i-activate-an-ssl-certificate

Amazingly, for namecheap, they give you the wrong host value, see the note about not including the domain name in the host value here:
https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9637/68/how-can-i-complete-the-domain-control-validation-dcv-for-my-ssl-certificate/#dns

Once the cert is issued, you can download and reup it to your server:
# unzip, then

# rename push the certs up to your bin
$ rsync -taPW live_newtube_app sshuser@your.ip.addy.here:~/


Generate the whatever thing (domain chain)
https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9419/33/installing-an-ssl-certificate-on-nginx/


$ cat your_domain.crt your_domain.ca-bundle >> your_domain_chain.crt

This command can be bugged, it can put the END CERTIFICATE and BEGIN CERTIFICIATE on the same line

It should instead look like this: (that's 5 dashes after the END CERTIFICATE)
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----


Add to server block:


server {
    	listen 80 default_server;
    	listen [::]:80 default_server;

    	server_name _;

        ## THESE PARTS HERE
        listen 443 ssl;

        ssl_certificate /home/fred/certs/uploads1_newtube_app_chain.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key /home/fred/certs/uploads1_newtube_app.key;

        ... more stuff ....
}


Then:

# test setup
sudo nginx -t

# restart nginx with new setup
sudo service nginx restart
